WEB ROLLER
The most accessible way to use this randomizer is the web roller here:
https://randorandy.github.io/ZFactorRando/

LOCAL DOWNLOAD
If you prefer an offline or custom experience, you may want to use python3 and roll locally:
1.download this repository
2.place a copy of the Redesign rom in the roms folder - it must be named Lost World.sfc
3.run Main.py in console
This should create a randomized rom with the given name in the roms folder and a spoiler log (.txt) in the spoilers folder.

THANKS
Thanks to beauxq, and without the Subversion rando none of these other projects would have been possible for me:
